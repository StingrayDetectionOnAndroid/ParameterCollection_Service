## Project Desctiprion
Working to develop a host-based and artificially-intelligent Stingray-Catcher for mobile networks, I developed this android application to record system parameters. The stingray catcher tries to detect anomalies by analyzing mobile-phone behaviour captured using this application.

## Dependencies
This project has been built in Android Studio, using Gradle configurations. Latest version of Android Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

## Installation
For installation, you just need to download/clone this repository.

## Demo/Usage
  1. Download the repository and open the project in Android Studio.
  2. Connect your mobile device with the Android Studio in debug mode and install the application in your mobile device. For assistance regarding debugging on real hardware, refer [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).
  3. Run the app on your device and observe the parameters such as mobile tower ID, GSM cell ID, etc., in real-time.

# Note
Based on your permission, the app may also log the observed parameters in a text file. This application is still under testing.

Please read them carefully before proceeding.
